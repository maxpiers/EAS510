WARNING: Due to the nature of the data collection process(sampling from all available movies on the TMDB API), the datasets contain some explicit imagery.

EAS510_Image_Model1.ipynb has been built for use in Google CoLab. 
To use: Save unzipped dataset to your google drive, update the 'drive_path' and 'content_path' variables to your location and folder name, and run all cells. 
One instance of 'model_trainer' has been prebuilt into the code, as well as commands to plot a sample of posters with predicted and true classes.
